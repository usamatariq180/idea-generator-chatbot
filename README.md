Assignment for candidates applying for the job of full stack developer at Willow in October 2024.

# Introduction

Welcome to the Willow Full-Stack Developer assignment. This repository contains the instructions for the assignment as well as a public Q&A section to help you during the process.

The goal of this task is to assess your abilities to 
* create a well functioning application,
* produce well-structured, maintainable code, 
* provide adquate documentation,
* facilitate running your application locally.

# Assginment

In this assignment, you will build a simple full-stack web application, containing both a front-tend and a back-end, that will allow users to 

* brainstorm with a chatbot to generate ideas, and
* command the chatbot to save certain of those ideas in a list.

As such the UI contains only a few simple elements:

* a chat interface, consisting of
  * a window showing the chat history
  * a text input field to add your messages to the chatbot
* a list containing all ideas saved so far, and
* a button to reset both the conversation and the saved ideas.

Don't forget to add clear instructions on how we can test your application locally.
